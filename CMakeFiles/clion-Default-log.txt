CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.

  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable PostgreSQL_ROOT is set to:

    /usr/pgsql-15

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
